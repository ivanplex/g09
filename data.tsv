Weird latency/slow internet connection to certain places. Weird latency/slow internet connection to certain places. It's odd, it's not terrible for other things except certain games or playing with other people (risk of rain, guild wars 2 etc) but fine with CS:GO or whatever, internet is generally slow and this is what my connection looks like when monitored.  
Issues with Broadband Posting this here because I cant see anything else on google with my exact issue (will update with more details If it gets fixed, etc etc). My broadband has been acting up randomly over the last few weeks (internet goes off, wifi stops working, etc). Contacted Vodafone last week and seemed fixed after removing panel from the thing on the wall and plugging the ethernet cable into the test port (the guy I spoke to seemed completely convinced it was fixed). The issue has continued since then but seemed less common, until today when it has been off most of the day. The power light on the hub is currently showing up as red. This isn't one of the options to select when you use the broadband app to diagnose issues with your broadband. If I turn the router off/on then the internet starts working again for a minute or so (power light turns white, wifi white and internet red flashing initially until turns white). This will last for a minute before the router seems to reset itself, power light turns red again and the hub cycles through the aforementioned steps. Anyone have this happen to them (i can go into more detail if asked, have to get ready for work now). I'm fairly certain its an issue with the router itself but can't contact Vodafone until 2morro morning.
SMTP Getaway Address for Vodafone Australia? Hi! Does anyone know the SMTP Gateway Address for Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Limited?
S10+ OR Vodafone MMS Issue I've looked around the forums, YouTube and on here for a solution. But I seem to be struggling to find a true, up-to-date answer.  So basically, I can't seem to send images as MMS. Whenever I want to send an image, it sends the file as a link. But I want it to come up as an MMS (or at least display the image in the conversation). I have a fully updated Samsung Galaxy S10+ running Android 10/One UI 2.  I have tried to reset my network settings, input a new Access Point with the settings that Vodafone (my carrier) provides on the website, but the problem persists. I try sending images to my partner's phone, and the what is sent is a Vodafone style link, which opens the image in a browser.  Anyone know of any solutions? Or even know what the problem could be down to (Phone/Carrier)?
